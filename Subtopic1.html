<td>Abstract</td>
<td>Site contains a deeper understanding of how virtual court hearings have transformed traditional courtrooms shifting the legal proceedings online. Suddenly the usual in person legal process has given the state, local, and federal judiciaries to handle the proceedings from the comfort of their home affecting the justice system overall. This results in benefitting the public as it will strength the relationship with the law by making it more accessible to others, a better attendance, less expenses, and a quicker way to share information. It positively affected the system by generating better experiences and continuity; these advantages made the court a more equitable place. Usually when attending court hearing there are physical barriers people face and will no longer be a problem; as well as possibly reducing the expenses being made to appear in court. There will be more active participation from judges, attorneys, and interpreters creating an inclusive and cohesive environment in the courtroom. </td>
